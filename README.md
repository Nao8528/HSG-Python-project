# HSG-Python-project
This project visualizes the past corona data for Switzerland and allows for an up-to-date monitoring of the pandemic in this country.
Firstly, the new corona cases are visualized over time in a bar chart. The output includes a bar chart of the data for the whole of Switzerland and of data for selected cantons. 
Secondly, the new corona cases are visualized on a map of Switzerland. This map shows the new corona cases over the last day.
Thirdly, the timeseries of the reproduction number of Switzerland is plotted on a line graph with reference to R = 1.
Finally, random forest is used to predict the new corona cases and the quality of the model is visualized on a line graph displaying the predicted and actual values.
